# SparseDenseRanking# SparseDenseRanking

A repository for exploring sparse (BM25) and dense (neural) ranking techniques over Istella22 and Financial Times datasets.

## Features
- Sparse and dense index creation using Lucene and neural models
- Evaluation of ranking effectiveness (e.g., NDCG, precision, recall)
- Support for Learning-to-Rank (LTR) models

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
